<h2> 
  Waffles are a batter-based food. They are eaten worldwide, often for breakfast with toppings like butter and syrup, but are also served as desserts or in savory dishes like chicken and waffles. Waffles vary by region, with notable examples including the fluffier, deeper-pocketed Belgian waffle and the sweeter, crispier Liège waffle made with caramelized pearl sugar.  
  Waffles originated in ancient Greece with flat cakes called obelios, but the modern grid-patterned waffle developed in the Netherlands and Belgium in the 15th century. The Dutch brought waffles to America in the 17th century, and the dish has continued to evolve over centuries with new recipes and a more prominent presence in the United States. Now that the relevant waffle knowledge is in your brain, its time to start. But first, you must make sure you have all the proper ingredients:
<ul>
  <li>  2¼ cups all-purpose flour</li> 
  <li>¼ cup granulated sugar </li>
  <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
  <li>¾ teaspoon salt</li>
  <li>2 cups milk</li>
  <li>½ cup unsalted butter melted</li>
  <li>2 large eggs</li>
  <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
</ul>

<h3> Now that you have confirmed the ingredients, do you have the all the equipment: 
<ul>
  <li>Waffle iron</li>
  <li>Mixing bowls</li>
  <li>whisk</li>
</ul>

  <div><p> for a little waffle secret....We recommend 3-4 small children for seasoning. We already covered how to prepare your children on our website.

  Anyways, they add a little spice like cinnamon but with more lore. Sometimes when I'm feeling silly I add 5 children. One time I used a pre-teen, but they lack personality, el oh el.</p></div>

<h4> It is time to make the best breakfast ever...
<ol>
  <li>preheat your waffle iron</li>
  <li>in the mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt. In a medium bowl, whisk together the milk, melted butter, eggs, and vanilla. Pour the milk mixture into the flour mixture and stir together just until combined.

  <li>Grease the hot waffle iron with butter or cooking spray. Add about 1/3 cup of batter for each waffle to the hot waffle iron. (The amount will depend on the size of your waffle maker so feel free to experiment with how much you add.)
